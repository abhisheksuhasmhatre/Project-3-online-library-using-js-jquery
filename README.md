# Project-3-online-library-using-js-jquery
I got the idea of making this site by looking at different libraries but a few of them having any online accounts. 
But most of them need their memberships. 
So i came up with a plan to make a library that could be used by anyone from a school going kid to an old man. links:
Practical and experimental Robotics
Library banner
Library logo
Electronic communication systems
Timeless steel
Error Page Image
Rest of the images of the papers are from my personal computer and papers uploaded are from my personal computer. 
As per requirements I have used bootstrap to make the design responsive on all the pages. 
I have used jQuery to make a SPA application page that combines podcast page and forum page into one. 
I have used jQuery for a image gallery on search page. Forms in PHP was used to make a email form on contactus page. 
SSI file was made that updates last updated time, file named footer.shtml. 
.htaccess page was formed to use the error page as well as to make a page work as authenticated login. 
Errors on previous project has been corrected. A font has been added as well. 
Above and beyond:I had already made a project using three.js 
I used that as my background by giving it a z= -1 index I was able to incorporate that into my project 2 and used in the index.html page. 
I used different forms to login into the first page form is used in index.html, signup.html and used buttons where ever necessary, 
I have used buttons almost on all the pages. On the first page I have used iQuery function to display current time on the top of the pages.
jQuery function was used to hide and show event list in animation fading out and fading in form. 
Javascript was used to show progress bars after enter button was clicked. 
Javascript Alert box displays a message after enter button is clicked. On eventlist page 
I have used javascript functions to pop up confirmation an alert boxes.
On forums page I have used javascript functions to pop up confirmation an alert boxes and shows progress bars 
after post and register button were clicked.
On podcast and on database search page I have used javascript functions to pop up confirmation an alert boxes 
after register and order now button were clicked respectively. On all the pages 
I have used bootstrap inputs to display different writing areas.
Error page uses jQuery to animate the image and text in the field.
